<td>My favourite game is Genshin Impact. Genshin is the first RPG and an 
open world game that I played. It's a fantasy game, very relaxing and 
fun to play. It has the best background music that you can listen while 
exploring. This game require big storage and graphic therefore it's 
best to play on a laptop or PC. You can download this game for free.

<td>My second favourite game is Danganronpa. It's a series and 
my fav is Danganronpa V3. I love this game as it is a detective type of game. 
I love solving mysteries of murder and I always impressed from their murder methods. 
To play this game, you need to use a controller. Both XBox and PlayStation 
cosntroller is fine. You can buy this game at <a href="https://store.
steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> 
with the price of RM69 for one series. That's where I buy most of my 
games.</td>

<td>Another RPG that I play is Wuthering Waves. It's quite similar to 
Genshin Impact, open-world action RPG. What makes it different is that 
this game mainly trained player to dodge and counter attack. This game 
is also free to play. <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/" target="_blank">

<td>Other than RPG, I really love rhythm game like HATSUNE MIKU: 
COLORFUL STAGE! also known as "Project SEKAI" or "Proseka". This game 
is very appealing by its catchy tunes, stunning visuals, and character 
development. This game is best play on a tablet as it has bigger screen 
but can also be played on mobile. Read more <a href="https://colorfulstage.com/" target="_blank">

but now I always buy it on Taobao as it is affordable with very high quality materials. 
I cosplay game and anime characters but mostly games because I play games more 
often than watching anime. Plus, games have the best character designs.</td>
